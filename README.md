## Project task

This is a solution to the [DevProjects](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/alpaca-image-generator-website-ce2oc0eus8). Created in React, using local alpacaConfig file. You are able to generate and download alpaca avatars. 

## Project overview

Firstly, I set up states for every single alpaca part. Then, displayed all image parts with the map method, and using the switch statement, parts are changing on the image. You are able to change its neck, mouth, hair, ears, eyes, leg, etc. There are 2 buttons, for generating random alpaca and downloading the image. Random generating was created by using the Math.floor(Math.random() * number of options) function. Downloading images is powered by DownloadJS and Html to image packages.
