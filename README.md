## Project task

This is a solution to the [DevProjects](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/alpaca-image-generator-website-ce2oc0eus8). Created in React, using local alpacaConfig file. You are able to generate and download alpaca avatars. 

## Project overview

Firstly, I set up states for every single alpaca part. Then, displayed all image parts with map method, and using switch statement, parts are changing on the image. You are able to change its neck, mouth, hair, ears, eyes, leg, etc. There are 2 buttons, for random generating alpaca and downloading image. Random generating was created by using Math.floor(Math.random() * number of options) function. Downloading image is powered by DownloadJS and Html to image packages.
